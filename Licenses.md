## 3. The "FairPlayer" mark

The **FairPlayer** name can only be used to uniquely identify **themes** that are compatible with the **[FairPlayer Music Player](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fairplayer)** application using **this SDK**.

You are **free** to use the **FairPlayer** name anywhere inside the **themes** you create including:

  - The Google Play listing:
    - Application title
    - Application short description
    - Application full description
    - Application icon
    - Application screenshots
    - Application feature image
  - Your theme's resources:
    - Drawables
    - Strings

under the following conditions:

  - You comply with Google Play's **[Terms of Service](http://play.google.com/intl/en_us/about/play-terms.html)**, **[Distribution Agreement](http://play.google.com/about/developer-distribution-agreement.html)** and **[Content Policy](https://play.google.com/about/developer-content-policy/)**
  - Your application is **fully compatible** with FairPlayer, which means:
    - The "Apply theme" mechanism is present and visible to the end user
    - The resources provided with this SDK are present
    - The end user can actually **apply and use** your theme with FairPlayer
  - You **never imply a direct relationship** with FairPlayer's creators
    - Either in the Google Play Store listing (theme description and/or any visual elements) or inside the application (menu elements, text or visual elements, notifications, Toast messages etc.)
    - In **any form of communication** (e-mail, social media, blogs, vlogs, interviews, forums, websites, written or printed media etc.) in **any context** with **any third party**
  - You do not use a developer name similar to "**FairPlayer Team**" or that includes the words "**FairPlayer**" or "**Fair Player**" in any form (case insensitive)

Your theme can also be compatible with other third party applications as long as it retains **full compatibility** with FairPlayer.

### Usage Notes

The usage of the "FairPlayer" mark should be in accordance with Google Play's **[Policies regarding Intellectual Property, Deception and Spam](https://play.google.com/about/ip-deception-spam/impersonation-ip/)**.

Assuming you have just created a **pink** theme for FairPlayer here are some theme names you might consider:

  - **GOOD**
    - Pink FairPlayer **Theme**
    - Pink FairPlayer **Skin**
    - Pink **skin for** FairPlayer
    - Pink **theme for** FairPlayer
    - Pink Player Skin
    - Pink Player Theme

  - **BAD**
    - **FairPlayer Pink**: theme names must **NOT** start with FairPlayer
    - **Pink FairPlayer**: users should know this is a theme, not a standalone application
    - **Pink Theme**: too generic, users should know what they are installing

Failure to comply with these naming policies will **likely** get your themes and/or Google Play developer account **[suspended](https://www.google.com/search?q=google+play+account+suspended)**.
