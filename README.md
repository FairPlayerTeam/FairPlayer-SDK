FreshPlayer is one of the most powerful music players ever developed for Android and its growing popularity makes it an ideal partner for Mobile Design Studios focused on developing personalization applications (themes).

Developing a theme for FairPlayer is really easy:

  1. Edit a few colors in **colors.xml**
  2. Edit the theme drawables with your favorite image processing tool
  3. Export and upload
  
No need to worry about Android 4 / Android 5+ compatibility issues or missing Java files or very complicated build steps.
