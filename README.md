This is the official **theme SDK** for the FairPlayer Music Player.
We have included a complete Eclipse project with:

  - All necessary resources
  - ProGuard configuration
  - "Apply theme" mechanism

# Get creative!

FreshPlayer is one of the most powerful music players ever developed for Android and its growing popularity makes it an ideal partner for Mobile Design Studios focused on developing personalization applications (themes).

Developing a theme for FairPlayer is really easy:

  1. Edit a few colors in **colors.xml**
  2. Edit the theme drawables with your favorite image processing tool
  3. Export and upload
  
No need to worry about Android 4 / Android 5+ compatibility issues or missing Java files or very complicated build steps.

### Usage Notes

  - Please respect Google Play's **naming convetion**, in other words name your themes "Pink FairPlayer **Theme**" or "Pink FairPlayer **Skin**" or "Pink theme **for FairPlayer**", **DO NOT** use FairPlayer as the first word in your app's title (ex.: "FairPlayer Pink" is **bad** - and it **will get your apps suspended**)
  - Please make sure that the **FairPlayer Logo** does not cover more than 25% of your app's icon
  - Please **DO NOT** use a developer name that implies a relationship with the official **FairPlayer Team** - this will also get you suspended from Google Play
